## Problem 1

Let’s load and describe the data!

``` r
library(p8105.datasets)
data("instacart")
```

The “instacart” dataset contains 1384617 rows and 15 columns.
Observations are items in orders by user. The dataset includes
order\_id, product\_id, add\_to\_cart\_order, reordered, user\_id,
eval\_set, order\_number, order\_dow, order\_hour\_of\_day,
days\_since\_prior\_order, product\_name, aisle\_id, department\_id,
aisle, department variables.

-   1.1 How many aisles are there, and which aisles are the most items
    ordered from?

``` r
instacart %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  mutate(aisle = factor(aisle)) %>% 
  pull(aisle) %>% levels()
```
